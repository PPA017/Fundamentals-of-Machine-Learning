        "= B[:, 1:3] will replaces the columns with index 3 to 5 of A with the columns with index 1 to 3 from B. To select columns (or rows) until the end of the matrix, you can leave the right hand side of the colon blank. For example, A[:, 2:] will only return elements from the $3^{rd}$ to last columns of $A$. If you leave the left hand size of the colon blank, you will select elements from the beginning of the matrix. For example, A[:, :2] selects the first two columns, and is equivalent to A[:, 0:2]. In addition, you can use negative indices to index arrays from the end. Thus, A[:, :-1] selects all columns of A except the last column, and A[:, -5:] selects the $5^{th}$ column from the end to the last column. Thus, you could use this together with the sum and power ($^{**}$) operations to compute the sum of only the elements you are interested in (e.g., `np.sum(z[1:]**2)`). In the starter code, `lrCostFunction`, we have also provided hints on yet another possible method computing the regularized gradient.\n",

        "In this part of the exercise, you will implement a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the same training set as before. The neural network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses. For this week, you will be using parameters from a neural network that we have already trained. Your goal is to implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use our weights for prediction. In next week’s exercise, you will write the backpropagation algorithm for learning the neural network parameters.\n",

In `numpy`, when you compute $z^{(2)} = \\theta^{(1)}a^{(1)}$, be sure that you index (and if necessary, transpose) $X$ correctly so that you get $a^{(l)}$ as a 1-D vector.\n",
